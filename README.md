## Python 

[Python for Everybody](https://www.py4e.com/) by the University of Michigan. Great introduction to Python programming.

[Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) by Al Sweigart. Did not regret reading. Tons of extremely useful skeletons for scripts you can use to automate office task, etc. See also [lotspaih/automateBoringStuffPython](https://github.com/lotspaih/automateBoringstuffPython).

[Applied Data Science with Python](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-python) by the University of Michigan. Genuinely challenging. Really pushes you to go out and try, try, try and try somemore, and than again for good measure. Requires alot of thinking on your own time to come up with solutions. Weekly assignments should take days to feel your way through.

## SQL

[SQL Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/default.asp) by w3schools. Quick and easy primer for SQL.

## VBA

[VBA](http://www.excel-easy.com/vba.html) and [excel](http://www.excel-easy.com/) use in general by excel-easy. Pretty extensive coverage, peruse according to own needs.
